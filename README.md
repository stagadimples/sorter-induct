**Project Description**

This project is aimed at addressing 2 main requirements:
1. preparing a form that maps out the layout of how parcels flow from the various packing areas to the sorter inducts.
2. setting up a model for computing the theoretical number of parcels that can be inducted to all the sorters in an hour.
